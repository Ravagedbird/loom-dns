Loom: Local neural DNS-no servers, no lag, pulsar-secured. Ends the it's always DNS problem by whispering straight to the source. Open-source firmware. Flash if you're brave.
Loom Because it's always DNS. We made the internet talk like a committee-servers shouting at servers, you waiting on the edge, every click a referendum on time. DNS isn't broken. It's just... slow. Loud. Leaky. Loom doesn't fix DNS. It ends it. One line: a neural net baked into your router, trained once on every site you'll ever love. No more root. No more resolution. You want news? Your machine whispers. The server whispers back. Done. No lag. No middleman. Just two minds that already knew where to go. And to make sure no one's lying? Every heartbeat's stamped with light from a pulsar thirty thousand light-years away. If it's not cosmic, it's not real. This is what the web feels like when it's not asking permission.
## How It Works (High-Level) 
1. Train Once, Run Forever : A slim neural net (~50MB, frozen weights) learns mappings like news → secure endpoint streams. Trained offline on public datasets of legit sites. No daily retrain-just pattern-match your intent to IPs.
2. Whisper Handshake : No DNS ping. Your router sends a nonce hashed with current pulsar phase (from our Cronochain kit-tiny, verifiable). Server echoes back. Mismatch? Block. Two-way, under 10ms. Ends phishing cold.
3. Updates as Gossip : Active chats (e.g., bank app) swap delta-weights (~3KB) mid-handshake. No cloud phoning home. Pulsar-signed, so tamper-proof. Fallback: old model works forever.
4. API for Smarts : Keep Loom dumb. Local AI (your phone's assistant) calls loom.resolve('weather')-gets the tunnel, pre-fetches if it knows your habits. No bloat, just a bridge. Power? Milliwatts on idle routers-less than WiFi scanning. Scales per-user, not per-server. Prototype: Flash OpenWRT, train on 100 sites, test your morning scroll. Why now? DNS eats 5% of global traffic. We end that. Open-source it all-fork, flash, fly. Boom-expands without fluff.
